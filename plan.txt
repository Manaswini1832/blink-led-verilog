Clock freq = 50Hz
=> Clock period = 1/50 = 0.02s = 2e7 nanoseconds which will be the simulation time unit in the test bench timescale

LED switches on at positive edge of the clock and stays on for 0.01s = 1e7 nanoseconds which is 50% of the clk period

DOESN'T WORK AS EXPECTED
NOT SURE WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG!!!
